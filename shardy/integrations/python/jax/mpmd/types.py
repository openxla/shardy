  Attributes:
    topology: A topology of SPMD Meshes. A topology is a mapping between mesh
      names and SPMD Meshes. Mesh names cannot have the `@cpu` suffix.
    name_to_mesh_assignment: A mapping between named computations and tensors to
      mesh names. Each mesh name is expected to be found in the topology.
    name_to_stage_assignment: A mapping between named computations and stage
      ids. Each stage id must be a positive integer. Two named_computations will
      be merged into the same computation iff they have the same stage id,
      transpose count (e.g., both are forward computations) and call_counter, if
      defined (c.f. mpmd.call docs).
    input_mesh_assignment: An assignment of inputs to mesh names (or None if
      unassigned), which must be a pytree prefix (e.g. one value in place of a
      whole subtree) of the input tree, in which case the leaves of the
      assignment are broadcasted to all values in the respective input subtree.
    output_mesh_assignment: An assignment of outputs to mesh names (or None if
      unassigned), which must be a pytree prefix (e.g. one value in place of a
      whole subtree) of the input tree, in which case the leaves of the
      assignment are broadcasted to all values in the respective input subtree.
    partitioning_options: The partitioning options to use for the MPMD
      partitioning. If left undefined, PartIR will read these options from absl
      flags. See `PartitioningOptions` for more details.
    spmd_mesh: A mesh representative of any mesh in the topology for SPMD
      partitioning purposes.
    read_input_output_mesh_from_shardings: If set, we will ignore the
      input_mesh_assignment and output_mesh_assignment and read the mesh
      assignment from the mpmd.jit in_shardings and out_shardings. Currently
      reading from arg shardings is not supported. TODO: b/377706756 - Read from
      arg shardings too, and migrate users to this and remove this option once
      stabilized.
    fragment_merge_rules: A sequence of fragment merge rules. Each merge rule
      contains a sequence of fragment metadata objects that should be merged
      into a single fragment, together with metadata for the resulting fragment.
