    way, constants can be sharded differently for every use, and no propagation
    is done between constants (or constant expressions).

def DataFlowEdgeOp : Sdy_Op<"data_flow_edge",
  [SameOperandsAndResultType]> {
  let summary = "data flow edge op.";

  let description = [{
    A data flow edge of some op X defines a bridge between a set of sources
    (each is either an operand of X or an operand of X's block terminator) and
    a set of targets (each is either a result of X or a block argument of X),
    such that all sources and targets should be sharded in the same way.

    An op can have multiple data flow edges that are orthogonal to one another.

    For example:

    ```mlir
      y_0, ..., y_n = while (x_0, ..., x_n)
                      ((pred_arg_0,... , pred_arg_n) { ... })
                      ((body_arg_0,..., body_arg_n) {
                        ...
                        return return_value_0, ..., return_value_n
                      })
    ```

    This while op has n data flow edges, the i-th data flow edges is between
    sources `x_i`, `return_value_i` and targets `y_i`, `pred_arg_i`,
    `body_arg_i`.

    An `sdy.data_flow_edge` takes as input the root target of an edge (can be
    any of the targets, but preferably an op result rather than a block
    argument), which shouldn't have any other uses. This op isn't pure because
    it can take an input that originally didn't have any uses.

    The `sdy.data_flow_edge` also holds an optional sharding for all targets of
    the edge, and that sharding should be updated instead of the targets'
    sharding (if can be attached) during propagation. This is useful when an op
    has many edges, as it's much more efficient to:
    - propagate through each edge separately.
    - update the sharding of each edge separately instead of all targets at once
      (e.g. an op has a single immutable `TensorShardingPerValueAttr` for result
      shardings).
    - add each edge to the worklist separately when the sharding of a source has
      changed.

    Propagation will propagate shardings between all sources and targets of a
    `sdy.data_flow_edge` as if it was a regular op with the sources as operands
    and targets as results, and an identity `sdy.op_sharding_rule`. That means
    that forward propagation is from sources to targets and backwards
    propagation is from targets to sources.

    We don't allow the input of a `sdy.data_flow_edge` to be defined by an
    `SdyDialect` op, so we can assume that it's defined by an op that has
    unregistered `sdy.sharding` attribute.

    NOTE: it's NOT the responsibility of the `sdy.data_flow_edge` to link
    between sources and targets, it's simply attached to the root target of the
    edge. The op that this edge is bound to (while in the example above) is
    responsible for providing this information.

    of the barrier op and its operand.
