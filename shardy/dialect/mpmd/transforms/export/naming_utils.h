// Returns an informative string for an array of UserOrigin attributes, suitable

// consecutive counters. For example:
//    ["f_1", "f_2", "f_3", "loss", "f_3"(1), "f_2"(1), "f_1"(1)]

// Returns a name for a fragment based on its metadata, i.e., its user origins,
// stage id and call counter, when defined.
//
// The returned name has the following format:
//   <name_from_origin>_<phase>
//
// Where `name_from_origin` includes a summary of all user origins:
//   - "stage<stage_id>" if `stage_id` is defined.
//   - "inferred" if the list of origins is empty.
//   - or the most frequent name from the list of origins, followed by a summary
//   of counters (e.g., block_1:3 for block 1, block 2, and block 3) followed by
//   "..." if there are other names different from the most frequent one.
//
// `phase` is a summary of the phases from the list of origins:
//   - "fwd" for each origin with transpose count 0.
//   - "bwd" for each origin with transpose count 1.
//   - "transpose<counter> for each origin with transpose count > 1.
//
// Note we don't include `call_counter` as part of the metadata used to generate
// the name, as fragments are often reused across different calls.

// Given a map from mesh names to lists of `CallSite`s, returns a name for the
// group of fragments that share the same code. The name is a best effort
// attempt to summarize the call sites across all meshes.
//
// The returned name has the following format:
//   <name>_<call_counter_summary>
//
// Where `name` is the name of the first (in lexicographic order) call site,
// computed from each fragment's metadata, and `call_counter_summary` is a
// summary of the call counters across all meshes, or empty if there is no call
// counter or if the call counters are inconsistent across meshes.
//
// Example:
//   - stage2_fwd_calls0to1
//   - stage2_fwd_calls1from0
//
// The call counter summary of each mesh is computed as follows:
//   - If there's a single call site, then we simply return "_call{counter}" or
// empty string otherwise.
//   - Otherwise, we check if the different call-sites are consistent with each
// other, assuming the different call sites result from a (forward or backward)
// loop over the same fragment (as it would happen with microbatching).
// In particular, if the different call sites have different names, or are not
// contiguously numbered, or they are not in ascending or descending order
// (based on a program order), then they most likely don't belong to the same
// loop. In these cases, we return an empty string. But when they are indeed
// consistent, then we return: "_calls{min_counter}to{max_counter}" for the
// ascending case, and "_calls{max_counter}from{min_counter}" for the descending
// case.
