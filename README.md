# Shardy

Shardy is an MLIR-based partitioning system. It is meant to be dialect
agnostic and provide extensive user control and debuggability features. It
includes an axis-based sharding representation, a set of compiler APIs,
functionality for sharding propagation, and plans for an SPMD partitioner.

For more information see the rfcs/docs directory.

## Status

Shardy is a work in progress. Currently the core dialect and c bindings are
fully functional. The python bindings are under development.
