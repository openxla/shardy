## Operations

### `sdy.all_gather` (sdy::AllGatherOp)

_Performs an all-gather communication along axes_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.all_gather` $gathering_axes $tensor `out_sharding````=```$out_sharding attr-dict `:` type($result)
```

Gathers chunks of a tensor along axes specified in `gathering_axes`.

The `gathering_axes` is a list of lists of axes. The outer list is over the
dimensions of the tensor. Each inner list specifies the axes along which a
separate gather should be performed on the respective dimension. It will be
applied to the sharding of the operand (`tensor`) to obtain the sharding of
the result (`out_sharding`).

Note that `out_sharding` is not used to determine the sharding of the
result. Instead, the sharding of the result is determined by the sharding of
the operand and the `gathering_axes`, and `out_sharding` must match this
inferred sharding.

Example:
```mlir
%1 = stablehlo.tanh(%0) {sdy.sharding = #sdy.sharding_per_value<[<@mesh, [{"a", "b", "c"}, {}, {"d"}\]>]>} : tensor<8x8x8xf32>
%2 = sdy.all_gather [{"b", "c"}, {}, {"d"}\] %1 out_sharding=<@mesh, [{"a"}, {}, {}\]> : tensor<8x8x8xf32>
```

**Constraints:**
- Must satisfy the constraints listed in `Sdy_CollectiveOpInterface`.
- Elements in `gathering_axes` must satisfy the constraints listed in
  `AxisRefListAttr`.
- Applying `gathering_axes` to the operand sharding gets `out_sharding`.

### `sdy.all_reduce` (sdy::AllReduceOp)

_Perform an all-reduce comunication along axes_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.all_reduce` $reduction_axes $tensor `out_sharding````=```$out_sharding attr-dict `:` type($result)
```

Reduces chunks of a tensor along axes specified in `reduction_axes`.
The order of `reduction_axes` is not important for the result, but can
affect the order of the corresponding replica groups.

**Constraints:**
- Must satisfy the constraints listed in `Sdy_CollectiveOpInterface`.
- `reduction_axes` must satisfy the constraints listed in `AxisRefListAttr`.
- The operand sharding and `out_sharding` must have equivalent dimension
  shardings.
- `reduction_axes` must not overlap with the operand dimension sharding and
  replicated axes (it can overlap with unreduced axes).
- `reduction_axes` must not overlap with the unreduced axes of
  `out_sharding`. In other words, `out_sharding` must be be replicated along
  `reduction_axes` (implicitly or explicitly).

### `sdy.all_slice` (sdy::AllSliceOp)

_Performs a dynamic-slice operation along axes_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.all_slice` $slicing_axes $tensor `out_sharding````=```$out_sharding attr-dict `:` type($result)
```

Slices chunks of a tensor along axes specified in `slicing_axes`. There is
an algebric duality between `sdy.all_slice` and `sdy.all_gather`.

The `slicing_axes` is a list of lists of axes. The outer list is over the
dimensions of the tensor. Each inner list specifies the axes along which a
slice should be performed on the respective dimension. It will be applied to
the sharding of the operand (`tensor`) to obtain the sharding of the result
(`out_sharding`).

Note that `out_sharding` is not used to determine the sharding of the
result. Instead, the sharding of the result is determined by the sharding of
the operand and the `slicing_axes`, and `out_sharding` must match this
inferred sharding.

Example:
```mlir
%1 = stablehlo.tanh(%0) {sdy.sharding = #sdy.sharding_per_value<[<@mesh, [{"a"}, {}, {}\]>]>} : tensor<8x8x8xf32>
%2 = sdy.all_slice [{"b", "c"}, {}, {"d"}\] %1 out_sharding=<@mesh, [{"a", "b", "c"}, {}, {"d"}\]> : tensor<8x8x8xf32>
```

**Constraints:**
- Must satisfy the constraints listed in `Sdy_CollectiveOpInterface`.
- Elements in `slicing_axes` must satisfy the constraints listed in
  `AxisRefListAttr`.
- Applying `slicing_axes` to the operand sharding gets `out_sharding`.

### `sdy.all_to_all` (sdy::AllToAllOp)

_Performs an all-to-all communication along axes_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.all_to_all` $params $tensor `out_sharding````=```$out_sharding attr-dict `:` type($result)
```

For each (axes, src_dim, tgt_dim) tuple in the parameter list, this
operation slices chunks of a tensor along dimension `tgt_dim` and axes
specified in `axes`, scatteres those chunks along the axes, and concatenates
them along dimension `src_dim`.

This operation is essentially a combination of an all-gather along `src_dim`
and `axes`, followed by an all-slice along `tgt_dim` and `axes`, i.e., a
suffix of the axes sharding dimension `src_dim` on the input tensor is
appended to the axes sharding dimension `tgt_dim` on the output tensor.

The all-to-all will be applied to the sharding of the operand (`tensor`) to
obtain the sharding of the result (`out_sharding`).

Note that `out_sharding` is not used to determine the sharding of the
result. Instead, the sharding of the result is determined by the sharding of
the operand, `src_dim`, `tgt_dim`, and `axes`, and `out_sharding` must match
this inferred sharding.

Example:
```mlir
%1 = stablehlo.tanh(%0) {sdy.sharding = #sdy.sharding_per_value<[<@mesh, [{"a", "b"}, {"c"}, {}, {}\]>]>} : tensor<8x8x4x4x32>
%2 = sdy.all_to_all [{"b"}: 0->2, {"c"}: 1->3] %1 out_sharding=<@mesh, [{"a"}, {}, {"b"}, {"c"}\]> : tensor<8x8x4x4x32>
```

**Constraints:**
- Must satisfy the constraints listed in `Sdy_CollectiveOpInterface`.
- The parameter list must not be empty.
- For each parameter in `params`:
  - Elements in `axes` must satisfy the constraints of `AxisRefAttr`.
  - `src_dim` and `tgt_dim` must be valid dimensions (non-negative and less
  than rank of tensor).
  - Any `src_dim` or `tgt_dim` must be unique across all parameters.
  - `src_dim` must be sorted in ascending order across all parameters.
- Moving `axes` from `src_dim` to `tgt_dim` in the operand sharding gets
  `out_sharding`.

### `sdy.collective_permute` (sdy::CollectivePermuteOp)

_Performs a collective-permute communication to replace axes_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.collective_permute` $tensor `out_sharding````=```$out_sharding attr-dict `:` type($result)
```

Sends a chunk of the input tensor from each device to another to
reorder/replace the axes that shard the tensor.

A collective permute can transform the input sharding such that each
dimension must be as sharded as it was before, i.e., it must be sharded
along axes whose product of sizes matches that of the axes that previously
sharded the tensor.

This is useful for reordering axes in a single dimension or across different
dimensions, and swapping sharded axes with replicated ones.

In the below example, the sharded tensor size is `tensor<1x4x2xf32>`, and
that is preserved by the collective permute.

Example:
```mlir
sdy.mesh @mesh = <["a"=2, "b"=2, "c"=4, "d"=2, "e"=2, "f"=2]>
%1 = stablehlo.tanh(%0) {sdy.sharding = #sdy.sharding_per_value<[<@mesh, [{"a", "c"}, {"f"}, {"d", "e"}\]>]>} : tensor<8x8x8xf32>
%2 = sdy.collective_permute %1 out_sharding=<@mesh, [{"c":(1)2, "b", "f"}, {"a"}, {"e", "d"}\]> : tensor<8x8x8xf32>
```

**Constraints:**
- Must satisfy the constraints listed in `Sdy_CollectiveOpInterface`.
- If input and output sharding have different meshes, then those meshes must
  have exactly the same axes and different order of device ids.
- For each dimension, the product of sharding axis sizes in `out_sharding`
  must match that of the corresponding operand dimension sharding.

### `sdy.constant` (sdy::ConstantOp)

_Constant operation_

Produces an `output` tensor from a constant `value`.

See:
https://github.com/openxla/stablehlo/blob/main/docs/spec.md#constant

NOTE: SDY defines its own constant op that isn't ConstantLike and doesn't
have a folder, so that we'll be able to duplicate constants without any
greedy pattern rewriter folding them back into a single constant. In this
way, constants can be sharded differently for every use, and no propagation
is done between constants (or constant expressions).

Example:
```mlir
%output = sdy.constant dense<[[0.0, 1.0], [2.0, 3.0]]> : tensor<2x2xf32>
```

### `sdy.data_flow_edge` (sdy::DataFlowEdgeOp)

_Data flow edge op._

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.data_flow_edge` $input (`sharding````=``` $sharding^)? attr-dict `:` type($result)
```

A data flow edge of some op X defines a bridge between a set of sources
(each is either an operand of X or an operand of X's block terminator) and
a set of targets (each is either a result of X or a block argument of X),
such that all sources and targets should be sharded in the same way.

An op can have multiple data flow edges that are orthogonal to one another.

For example:

```mlir
  y_0, ..., y_n = while (x_0, ..., x_n)
                  ((pred_arg_0,... , pred_arg_n) { ... })
                  ((body_arg_0,..., body_arg_n) {
                    ...
                    return return_value_0, ..., return_value_n
                  })
```

This while op has n data flow edges, the i-th data flow edges is between
sources `x_i`, `return_value_i` and targets `y_i`, `pred_arg_i`,
`body_arg_i`.

An `sdy.data_flow_edge` takes as input the owner of an edge (can be
any of the targets, but preferably an op result rather than a block
argument), which shouldn't have any other uses. This op isn't pure because
it can take an input that originally didn't have any uses.

The `sdy.data_flow_edge` also holds an optional sharding for all targets of
the edge, and that sharding should be updated instead of the targets'
sharding (if can be attached) during propagation. This is useful when an op
has many edges, as it's much more efficient to:
- propagate through each edge separately.
- update the sharding of each edge separately instead of all targets at once
  (e.g. an op has a single immutable `TensorShardingPerValueAttr` for result
  shardings).
- add each edge to the worklist separately when the sharding of a source has
  changed.

Propagation will propagate shardings between all sources and targets of a
`sdy.data_flow_edge` as if it was a regular op with the sources as operands
and targets as results, and an identity `sdy.op_sharding_rule`. That means
that forward propagation is from sources to targets and backwards
propagation is from targets to sources.

We don't allow the input of a `sdy.data_flow_edge` to be defined by an
`SdyDialect` op, so we can assume that it's defined by an op that has
unregistered `sdy.sharding` attribute.

NOTE: it's NOT the responsibility of the `sdy.data_flow_edge` to link
between sources and targets, it's simply attached to the owner of the edge.
The op that this edge is bound to (while in the example above) is
responsible for providing this information.

### `sdy.manual_computation` (sdy::ManualComputationOp)

_Multi-device parallelism operation with manual collectives_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.manual_computation` `(`operands`)`
              `in_shardings````=```custom<StrippedTensorShardingPerValueAttr>($in_shardings)
              `out_shardings````=```custom<StrippedTensorShardingPerValueAttr>($out_shardings)
              `manual_axes````=```$manual_axes
              custom<SingleBlockRegionNoBlockId>($body)
              attr-dict
              `:`
              functional-type(operands, results)
```

Jump into a region written in terms of per-device local code with explicit
collectives, where logical shapes match local per-device physical buffer
shapes and collectives correspond exactly to physical cross-device
communication.

The body is local wrt the manual_axes. Propagation will occur through
the body on any free axes - those not in the manual_axes list.

Note that any unranked tensors are expected to have a sharding with rank 0,
i.e. fully replicated.

**Constraints:**
- Elements in `in_shardings` and `out_shardings` must satisfy the constraints listed in `TensorShardingAttr`.
- The number of global and local tensor inputs/outputs of the op region must match.
- The manual axes must come before any free axes in each dim sharding.
- The manual axes cannot introduce padding. Namely, the dimension size must be divisible by the corresponding manual axes size.
- The global and local shapes of the op regions arguments/results must match.

### `sdy.mesh` (sdy::MeshOp)

_Named mesh_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.mesh` $sym_name `=` $mesh attr-dict
```

Defines a new named mesh. All meshes in a module must have the same number
of devices (except for meshes with a single device_id).
The mesh is a `Symbol` operation that appears in the module's
`SymbolTable` and can be referenced by its `name`.

### `sdy.named_computation` (sdy::NamedComputationOp)

_Named computation operation_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.named_computation` `<`$name`>` `` `(` $operands `)`
              (`in_shardings````=```custom<StrippedTensorShardingPerValueAttr>($in_shardings)^)?
              (`out_shardings````=```custom<StrippedTensorShardingPerValueAttr>($out_shardings)^)?
              custom<SingleBlockRegionNoBlockId>($body)
              attr-dict
              `:` functional-type($operands, results)
```

Groups a computation, i.e. a block of operations, and gives it a name.
Propagation will flow in/out of the region as if everything was inlined.

This can be used to handle propagating through call instructions to other
functions. Any users of Shardy should write an import/export pass that
converts their call ops to `sdy.named_computation` ops, duplicating/copying
the body of the called function into the body of the `named_computation`.

The type of each block arguments and returned values in the region must be
the same as the type of the operands and results type of the op.

Example:

```mlir
%1 = sdy.named_computation<"foo">(%0) (%arg1: tensor<16x32xf32>) {
  sdy.return %arg1 : tensor<16x32xf32>
} : (tensor<16x32xf32>) -> tensor<16x32xf32>

### `sdy.propagation_barrier` (sdy::PropagationBarrierOp)

_Propagation barrier operation_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.propagation_barrier` $input `allowed_direction````=```$allowed_direction attr-dict `:` type($input)
```

This op operates like an identity op, outputting the same value it took as
input. But in terms of propagation, this will only allow propagation to flow
through it in a certain direction.

This prevents shardings from being propagated between the uses of the result
of the barrier op and its operand.

- `FORWARD` means shardings can only flow from the operand to the result.
- `BACKWARD` means shardings can only flow from the result to the operand.
- `NONE` means no sharding can propagate through this op.
- Cannot specify `BOTH`, as this op would be redundant.

_Performs a reduce-scatter communication along axes_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.reduce_scatter` $reduce_scatter_axes $tensor `out_sharding````=```$out_sharding attr-dict `:` type($result)
```

Reduces chunks of a tensor along axes specified in `reduce_scatter_axes`,
and then scatters the result along the same axes. This operation is
essentially a combination of an `sdy.all_reduce` followed by an
`sdy.all_slice` along the same `reduce_scatter_axes`.

**Constraints:**
- Must satisfy the constraints listed in `Sdy_CollectiveOpInterface`.
- Elements in `reduce_scatter_axes` must satisfy the constraints listed in
  `AxisRefListAttr`.
- Applying `reduce_scatter_axes` to the operand sharding gets
  `out_sharding`.

### `sdy.reshard` (sdy::ReshardOp)

_Reshards a tensor to a different sharding_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.reshard` $input $sharding attr-dict `:` type($result)
```

  Reshards the input tensor with the specified sharding, which is different
  from the input tensor's existing sharding.

  Both ShardingConstraintOp and ReshardOp attach a sharding to a tensor. Their
  lifespan is:
  1. Before sharding propagation, ShardingConstraintOp is added by users.
  2. Sharding propagation consumes ShardingConstraintOp. There is no
     ShardingConstraintOp in the results of sharding propagation. Instead,
     ReshardOp may be added if needed.
  3. A partitioner converts a ReshardOp into a collective op (or an identity
     op). There should be no ReshardOp in the results of the partitioner.

// TODO(b/331680067). Add a canonicalization pattern to remove redundant
// reshard ops.

### `sdy.return` (sdy::ReturnOp)

_The `sdy.return` operation terminates the regions attached to
    `sdy` region-based ops and any other Shardy region-based ops. It is
    variadic: it takes as arguments a list of values whose types can be any (but
    of the same kind, e.g. `AnyTensor`) and therefore can be reused at various
    levels of the Shardy IR stack._

### `sdy.sharding_constraint` (sdy::ShardingConstraintOp)

_Constrains a tensor to the specified sharding_

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.sharding_constraint` $input $sharding attr-dict `:` type($result)
```

Attaches a sharding to an intermediate tensor (e.g. the result of a matmul)
to indicate that this is how that tensor, or a subset of its uses, should be
sharded.

If the sharding has open dimensions and unconstraint axes, it means the
tensor can be further sharded along the open dimensions.

This op can either:
- Have no uses (dangling) - which means the attached sharding is how the
  input tensor itself should be sharded.
- Have uses - which means the attached sharding is how the uses of the
  sharding constraint op should be sharded, while other uses of the input
  tensor might have a different sharding (if the input tensor has no other
  uses then the behavior is the same as the no uses case).

### `sdy.sharding_group` (sdy::ShardingGroupOp)

_Constrains tensors in the group to have the same sharding._

Syntax:

```
operation ::= `sdy.sharding_group` $input `group_id````=```$group_id attr-dict `:` type($input)
```

This op provides an interface to assign tensors to sharding groups (
groups of tensors that will be enforced to have identical shardings).
During propagation, as soon as one group element is sharded, all other
members will be sharded in exactly the same way. This operation takes the
argument group ID and returns no result, but instead modifies the internal
sharding group representation to add the input tensor to the group with the
given ID.

### MeshAttr

_Mesh of axes and a list of devices_

Syntax:

```
#sdy.mesh<
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<MeshAxisAttr>,   # axes
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>   # device_ids
>
```

A mesh is a list of axes and an optional list of device IDs specifying the
device ordering.

If the list of axes is empty, the mesh has an implicit unnamed axis of
size 1. In this case, if a device ID list is not provided, the implicit
device ID list is [0]; if a device ID list is provided, it must
contains a single integer of any non-negative value. We call this
maximal-sharding case.

For all non-maximal-sharding cases, if a device ID list is specified, the
product of the axis sizes should match the number of devices. If a device ID
list is not specified, the implicit device ID list is iota(product(axes)).
For simplicity, we also disallow specifying a device ID list that is the
same as iota(product(axes)); in this case, a device ID list shouldn't be
specified.

Here are some examples of meshes:

- An empty mesh represents a placeholder mesh that can be replaced during
  propagation: <[]>
- A mesh with an unnamed axis and an explicit device ID, which is typically
  used to represent maximal sharding: <[], device_ids=[3]>
- A mesh with two axes and implicit device IDs iota(6): <["a"=2, "b"=3]>
- A mesh with two axes and explicit device IDs specifying the device
  ordering: <["a"=3, "b"=2], device_ids=[0, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5]>

**Constraints:**
- Elements in `axes` must not have duplicate names.
- If `device_ids` is specified:
  * The product of axis sizes must match the number of devices.
  * All of its elements must be non-negative.
  * `device_ids` should not be equal to `iota(product(axis_sizes))`.
  * Sorted `device_ids` must be `iota(product(axis_sizes))`.

#### Parameters:

| Parameter | C++ type | Description |
| :-------: | :-------: | ----------- |
| axes | `::llvm::ArrayRef<MeshAxisAttr>` | mesh axes |
| device_ids | `::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>` | explicit device ordering or maximal device id |

### MeshAxisAttr

Syntax:

```
#sdy.mesh_axis<
  ::llvm::StringRef,   # name
  int64_t   # size
>
```

#### Parameters:

| Parameter | C++ type | Description |
| :-------: | :-------: | ----------- |
| name | `::llvm::StringRef` | name |
| size | `int64_t` | size of this axis |

### OpShardingRuleAttr

_Specifies how an operation can be partitioned._

Syntax:

```
#sdy.op_sharding_rule<
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>,   # factor_sizes
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<TensorMappingAttr>,   # operand_mappings
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<TensorMappingAttr>,   # result_mappings
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>,   # reduction_factors
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>,   # need_replication_factors
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>,   # permutation_factors
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>,   # blocked_propagation_factors
  bool   # is_custom_rule
>
```

A sharding rule specifies how an operation can be partitioned according to
various properties on the op - any attributes, the shape of operands,
the shape of the results, etc. For example:

```
%0 = stablehlo.add %arg0, %arg1 {
    sdy.sharding_rule = #sdy.op_sharding_rule<
        ([i, j],[i, j])->([i, j])
        {i=8, j=8}>
} : tensor<8x8xf32>
```

```
%1 = stablehlo.dot_general %arg2, %arg3, contracting_dims = [1] x [0] {
  sdy.sharding_rule = #sdy.op_sharding_rule<
      ([i, k],[k, j])->([i, j])
      {i=8, j=16, k=8}>
}: (tensor<8x8xf32>, tensor<8x16xf32>) -> tensor<8x16xf32>
```

Note that we allow factors with size 1 even though they cannot be sharded,
this is mainly for completeness as many ops such as pointwise ops have size
one dimensions that correspond across operands and results.

**Factor types:**
- `reduction_factors` contains the indices of factors requiring reduction,
  such as the contracting dimensions in a dot operation.
- `need_replication_factors` contains the indices of factors requiring full
  replication, such as the sorted dimension in a sort operation.
- `permutation_factors` contains the indices of factors requiring
  collective-permute if they are sharded, such as the padding dimensions in
  a pad operation.
- All other factors are considered as pass-through factors, i.e., factors
  that don't require any communication if sharded in the same way across all
  tensors that are mapped to them.

`blocked_propagation_factors` contains the factors along which shardings are
not allowed to be propagated. It is orthogonal to the factor types. Namely,
a blocked-propagation factor can be any of the factor types.

`is_custom_rule` describes whether this is a rule defined by a user. Users
can define sharding rules for their custom calls or overwrite the
pre-defined sharding rules for the standard operations. A custom rule is
always preserved/never removed.

**Constraints:**
- Number of operand/result mappings must match the number of
  operands/results of the op.
- There is at least one mapping (can't have a rule for an op with no
  operands/results).
- Rank of each `TensorMappingAttr` matches the rank of the corresponding
  tensor type.
- For each group of factors (`reduction_factors`,
  `need_replication_factors`, `permutation_factors`):
  * Elements must be in range [0, `$factor_sizes`].
  * No duplicate factor indices within each group and across groups.

#### Parameters:

| Parameter | C++ type | Description |
| :-------: | :-------: | ----------- |
| factor_sizes | `::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>` | sizes of all factors in this rule |
| operand_mappings | `::llvm::ArrayRef<TensorMappingAttr>` | operand mappings |
| result_mappings | `::llvm::ArrayRef<TensorMappingAttr>` | result mappings |
| reduction_factors | `::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>` | factors requiring reduction |
| need_replication_factors | `::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>` | factors requiring full replication |
| permutation_factors | `::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>` | factors requiring collective-permute |
| blocked_propagation_factors | `::llvm::ArrayRef<int64_t>` | factors along which shardings are not propagated |
| is_custom_rule | `bool` | whether the rule is for a stablehlo.custom_call |

### SubAxisInfoAttr

_Info about how this sub-axis is derived from the full axis_

Syntax:

```
#sdy.sub_axis_info<
  int64_t,   # pre_size
  int64_t   # size
>
```

When splitting a full axis into n sub-axes, the axis is reshaped into
[k_1,...,k_n], and the ith sub-axis can be expressed by the product of all
axis sizes to its left `m=prod(k_1,...,k_(i-1))` (aka pre-size) and size
k_i. Therefore, the sub-axis-info attribute holds those two numbers and is
denoted as follows: `(m)k` for pre-size m and size k.

**Constraints:**
- `pre-size` is at least 1.
- `size` is greater than 1.
- `pre-size` must divide the size of the full axis, i.e., both `pre-size`
  and `size` divide the size of the full axis, and the sub-axis doesn't go
  beyond the full axis.
- The size of the sub-axis isn't equal to the size of the corresponding full
  axis, in which case the full axis should be used instead.

#### Parameters:

| Parameter | C++ type | Description |
| :-------: | :-------: | ----------- |
| pre_size | `int64_t` | product of sub-axis sizes to the left of this sub-axis |
| size | `int64_t` | size of this sub-axis |

### TensorMappingAttr

_Factor mappings for each dimension of a tensor._

Syntax:

```
#sdy.tensor_mapping<
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<DimMappingAttr>   # dim_mappings
>
```

**Constraints:**
- Elements in `dim_mappings` must satisfy the constraints in `DimMappingAttr`.
- No duplicate factors indices across dimensions.

#### Parameters:

| Parameter | C++ type | Description |
| :-------: | :-------: | ----------- |
| dim_mappings | `::llvm::ArrayRef<DimMappingAttr>` | dimension mappings |

### TensorShardingAttr

_Tensor sharding_

Syntax:

```
#sdy.sharding<
  ::mlir::Attribute,   # mesh_or_ref
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<DimensionShardingAttr>,   # dim_shardings
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<AxisRefAttr>,   # replicated_axes
  ::llvm::ArrayRef<AxisRefAttr>   # unreduced_axes
>
```

A tensor sharding is bound to a specific mesh, and can only reference axis
names from that mesh. The dimension shardings tell us for each dimension of
the tensor, along which axes (or sub-axes) it is sharded from major to
minor. All other axes that don’t shard a dimension are either implicitly or
explicitly (if they appear in the list of replicated axes) replicated.

Note that no sharding attribute on a tensor is equivalent to a fully open
tensor sharding.

The mesh this sharding is bound to can either be specified by a symbol
name, referencing a corresponding `MeshOp` symbol, or an inlined `MeshAttr`.

A sharding can have unreduced axes (specified by `unreduced_axes`), meaning
the tensor is unreduced along these axes. For example, if the contracting
dimension of a matmul is sharded along axis `x` in both the lhs and rhs, the
result is unreduced along `x`. Applying an all-reduce on the tensor along
the unreduced axes will make the tensor replicated along those axes.
However, a tensor with unreduced axes doesn't have to be all-reduced
immediately, it can remain unreduced when passed to linear operations like
`stablehlo.add` (as long as both lhs and rhs are unreduced) and all-reduced
afterwards. We assume the reduction type is sum, other reductions may be
supported in the future.

**Constraints:**
- Elements in `dim_shardings` must satisfy the constraints listed in
  `DimensionShardingAttr`.
- Elements in `replicated_axes` must satisfy the constraints listed in
  `AxisRefListAttr`.
- Elements in `unreduced_axes` must satisfy the constraints listed in
  `AxisRefListAttr`.
- If the corresponding tensor type isn't a `ShapedType`, the sharding must
  have rank 0 and no replicated axes.
- If it is a `ShapedType`, then:
  - The tensor should have a rank.
  - The number of dimension shardings is equal to the rank of the tensor.
  - Dimensions of size 0 aren't sharded.
- There are no duplicate axis-refs or sub-axes that overlap with one another
  across `dim_shardings`, `replicated_axes`, and `unreduced_axes`.
- Items in `replicated_axes` and `unreduced_axes` are ordered w.r.t.
  `mesh_or_ref` (see `AxisRefAttr::getMeshComparator`).

#### Parameters:

| Parameter | C++ type | Description |
| :-------: | :-------: | ----------- |

| dim_shardings | `::llvm::ArrayRef<DimensionShardingAttr>` | dimension shardings |
| replicated_axes | `::llvm::ArrayRef<AxisRefAttr>` | axis refs |
| unreduced_axes | `::llvm::ArrayRef<AxisRefAttr>` | axis refs |
