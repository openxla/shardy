### `-sdy-insert-explicit-reshards`

_Inserts explicit reshards to make all operations have compatible shardings._

A compatible sharding essentially means that the operation can accept the
sharded operands and produce a sharded result without requiring any reshard
communications (note that the operation might still require communication
such as all-reduce or halo-swaps).

After propagation, some opeartions may still have incompatible shardings.

Please note, when an axis (or sub-axis) is used to shard non-corresponding
dimensions (e.g. non-contracting dimensions in matmul) across multiple
tensors, or when an axis shards a dimension in one tensor but not the
corresponding dimension in the other tensor, it is said that the operation
has a sharding conflict. Hence, after this pass, the opeartions become
conflict-free.

This pass injects reshard operations explicitly so that, for each operation,
corresponding dimensions become sharded in the same way across all operands
and results, and every axis (or sub-axis) can only be used to shard a single
dimension type.

A clarifying example:

Input:
```mlir
mesh = <"x"=4, "y"=2>
%lhs : tensor<8x32xf32> {sdy.sharding=<@mesh, \[{"y"},{"x"}\]>}
%rhs : tensor<32x16xf32> {sdy.sharding=<@mesh, \[{"y"}, {"x"}\]>}
stablehlo.dot %lhs, %rhs {sdy.sharding_per_value=<[<@mesh, \[{"x"}, {}\]>]>}
  : (tensor<8x32xf32>, tensor<32x16xf32>) -> tensor<8x16xf32>
```

Output:
```mlir
sdy.mesh = <"x"=4, "y"=2>
%lhs : tensor<8x32xf32> {sdy.sharding=<@mesh, \[{"x"}, {"y"}\]>}
%rhs : tensor<32x16xf32> {sdy.sharding=<@mesh, \[{"y"}, {"x"}\]>}
%0 = sdy.reshard %rhs <@mesh, \[{"y"}, {}\]> : tensor<32x16xf32>
stablehlo.dot %lhs, %0 {sdy.sharding_per_value=<[<@mesh, \[{"x"}, {}\]>]>}
  : (tensor<8x32xf32>, tensor<32x16xf32>) -> tensor<8x16xf32>
```

In the example above, there is a conflict since `lhs` and `rhs` tensors
are both sharded on axis "x" on their non-contracting dimensions. Here,
`rhs` tensor is resharded, before the dot operation, explicitly to be
sharded only on its first dimension and on axis "x". This way, the dot
opearation becomes compatible.
### `-sdy-sharding-constraint-to-reshard`

_Converts ShardingConstraintOp into ReshardOp._

### `-sdy-sink-data-flow-edges`

_Sinks all `DataFlowEdgeOp` into their input._

Moves the sharding of each `DataFlowEdgeOp` to its input (the root target of
the edge), and replaces the op with its input.

TODO(tomnatan): consider moving the sharding to all targets that can have a
sharding attached.
### `-sdy-update-non-divisible-input-output-shardings`

_Makes FuncOp inputs/outputs evenly sharded, removing any need for padding due to non-divisible shardings._

Users of Shardy expect the function inputs/outputs to be evenly
divisible/shardable to avoid requiring padding their tensors. Propagation
may make inputs/outputs have non-divisible shardings, so this pass updates
them to the largest dimension sharding prefix of the original sharding that
is evenly sharded.
